/**
 * @file ring_buffer.h
 * @brief Lock-free ring buffer for screen frames.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - Single writer (capture thread) calls begin_write() / commit_write().
 *     Uses a dedicated mutex to serialize slot writes.
 *   - Multiple readers (action worker) call find_pre_frame / find_post_frame.
 *     Completely LOCK-FREE — only reads the atomic head index and scans slots.
 *   - Each slot has a sequence number that increments on each write.
 *     Readers detect if a slot was mid-write by checking sequence parity.
 *   - Frames are stored as raw RGB bytes in pre-allocated vectors.
 *
 * This design eliminates reader-writer lock contention entirely.
 * At 10 FPS, the writer holds the mutex for ~2-5ms per frame (RGB copy).
 * Reader lookups are O(capacity) scans with no blocking.
